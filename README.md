# 👋 Hi, I'm Gustavo

I'm a **Software Developer** with **4+ years of experience**, working across **Front-end and Full-stack development**, specialized in **React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript**.

I started my career with a strong focus on **Front-end**, where I spent around **3 years** building **modern, performant, secure, and responsive interfaces**. Since **2024**, I’ve been working as a **Full-stack Developer**, expanding my expertise in **back-end development and software architecture**, with consistent attention to **scalability, maintainability, and security**.

I’m **proactive**, **results-oriented**, and deeply passionate about **continuous learning**, always applying **best practices** to deliver high-quality and reliable software.

Above all, I believe software is a powerful tool to **create positive transformations in the world** when built with care, clarity, responsibility, and purpose.
